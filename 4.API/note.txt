i incounter a problem when i was coding in the files when i run the code it coudnt find the prper path to solve this problem i used :

import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);


so it got solved but for rendering the ejs file i had another problem which i solved with installing ejs package:

npm install ejs

and to run the proper indication i run this script in :

app.set("view engine","ejs");                        # this make ejs as a veiw engine


and to render it just put the name in it :

res.render("index")


=====================================================================================================================================================

there are two types of api public and privet:

it happens with request and responses

if we request from your server its a privet api and if its from another server its punlic api.

endpoint :
baseURL/Endpoint 
it could be differnt every time is basically a differnt rout on the api provider server


query parameters
baseURL/endpoint?query=value

if you want to put additional information or some parameters to a request we use query its like a key and value.
if there are multiple querys you can use & sign to make it possible for example
baseURL/endpoint?query=value&query=value
this is for filtering 

path parameters:
baseURL/endpoint/{path-parameters}
if you want to find a specific resource in the api you can udentify that with path parameters
this is for a specific resource
